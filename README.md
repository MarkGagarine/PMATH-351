# PMATH-351
This repository contains selected works from my Real Analysis course (PMATH-351) taken in Winter 2024 with Professor Alexandru Nica. It includes my final paper on probability measures in metric spaces that explore measure theory, the Carath√©odory's Extension Theorem, and applications in probability.
